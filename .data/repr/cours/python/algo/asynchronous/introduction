Explanation of the **__Asyncronous Programming__**

Asynchronous Programming is based around the concept of jumping from one task to another.

Retrieving data from the DB or requesting a resource from a server requires time, and especially waiting the third party (SQL server, or other Web server).

Asynchronous therefore makes it possible to **await** these resources without blocking the server, or the program. it will be able to do something else besides, within the framework of a web server, Take care of another request.
Or in a game display a loading screen while waiting for all the data to be loaded,
This is called concurency.
