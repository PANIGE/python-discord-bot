**__How to Make a Discord Bot in Python__**

Since you’re learning how to make a Discord bot with Python, you’ll be using `discord.py`.

discord.py is a Python library that exhaustively implements Discord’s APIs in an efficient and Pythonic way. This includes utilizing Python’s implementation of Async IO.

Begin by installing discord.py with pip:

```sh
$ pip install -U discord.py
```

Now that you’ve installed discord.py, you’ll use it to create your first connection to Discord!


**__Creating a Discord Connection__**

The first step in implementing your bot user is to create a connection to Discord. With discord.py, you do this by creating an instance of Client:

```py
# bot.py
import os

from discord.ext import commands

TOKEN = "Your Token"

bot = commands.Bot(command_prefix='!')

@bot.event
async def on_ready():
    print(f'{client.user} has connected to Discord!')

bot.run(TOKEN)
```

A Client is an object that represents a connection to Discord. A Client handles events, tracks state, and generally interacts with Discord APIs.pourquoi
